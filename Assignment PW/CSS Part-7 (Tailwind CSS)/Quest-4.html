                Isaacson is the author of multiple published books including Kissinger: A Biography (1992), Benjamin Franklin: An American Life (2003), Einstein: His Life and Universe (2007) and American Sketches (2009). He additionally co-authored with Evan Thomas the work The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made (1986).[2][17] On October 24, 2011, Steve Jobs, Isaacson's authorized biography of Apple Inc.'s Jobs, was published by Simon & Schuster, only several weeks after Jobs' death. <br/> It became an international best-seller, breaking all records for sales of a biography. The book was based on over forty interviews with Jobs over a two-year period up until shortly before his death, and on conversations with friends, family members, and business rivals of the entrepreneur.[18][19][20][21][22] In October 2014, Isaacson published The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, which explores the history of the key technological innovations that are prominent in the digital revolution, most notably the parallel developments of the computer and the Internet. It became a New York Times bestseller.[23] Writing for the New York Times, Janet Maslin described the author as "a kindred spirit to the visionaries and enthusiasts" whom Isaacson wrote about.[24] He is the editor of Profiles in Leadership: <br/>
                Historians on the Elusive Quality of Greatness (2010, W. W. Norton).[3][25] His biography of Leonardo da Vinci was published on October 17, 2017, to positive reviews from critics.[26][27] In August 2017, Paramount Pictures won a bidding war against Universal Pictures for the rights to adapt Isaacson's biography of da Vinci. The studio bought the rights under its deal with Leonardo DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions, which said that it planned to produce the film with DiCaprio as the star.[28] Screenwriter John Logan (The Aviator, Gladiator) has been tapped to pen the script.[29]
                His book The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race was published in March 2021 by Simon & Schuster. It is a biography of Jennifer Doudna, the winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on the CRISPR system of gene editing.[30] The book debuted at number one on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for the week ending March 13, 2021.[31] Publishers Weekly called it a "gripping account of a great scientific advancement and of the dedicated scientists who realized it."[32] In August 2021, entrepreneur Elon Musk announced that Isaacson was in the process of writing his biography
