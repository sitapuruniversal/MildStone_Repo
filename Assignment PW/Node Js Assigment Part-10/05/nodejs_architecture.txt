js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.
 Node.js uses the Single Threaded Event Loop architecture to handle multiple clients at the same time. To understand how this is different from other runtimes, we need to understand how multi-threaded concurrent clients are handled in languages like Java In a multi-threaded request-response model, multiple clients send a request, and the server processes each one before sending the response back. However, multiple threads are used to process concurrent calls. These threads are defined in a thread pool, and each time a request comes in, an individual thread is assigned to handle it.
